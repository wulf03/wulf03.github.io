# Projects
The project of the day: Step-by-step assignment

1.  Create a repository for your site. By convention, personal sites are named username.github.io where username is your GitHub username, but you can enable GitHub Pages for any GitHub repository.

2. Create a scaffold site using Jekyll.

3. Add the GitHub Pages gem to the site’s Gemfile. See the instructions from the GitHub Pages Ruby Gem for more details.

4. Preview your site locally using Jekyll. It’s always a good idea to view the site after making changes and before pushing your changes to GitHub.

5. Select a theme for your site. Remember that sites published using GitHub Pages must use one of the supported themes or the Jekyll Remote Theme.

6. Add content to your site. You must create at least five pages or five posts. The pages or posts for the scaffold site do not count unless, of course, you just so happen to have a file with the same name (e.g., about.md).

7. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.

8. Enable GitHub Pages for your repository.

9. Wait a few minutes and then view your website online!
